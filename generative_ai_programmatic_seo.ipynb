    "# Using generative AI with structured data for programmatic SEO\n",

    "Prompt engineering is one of the hot topics these days, and it is constantly changing due to rapid changes in the guidelines, the underlying technologies' capabilities, as well as our understanding of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is mostly known as making many attempts, changing, rewriting, until you find a prompt that works for the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to build on this and share a pattern of using building prompt **templates** that can be used in bulk, for the creation of product descriptions, email marketing messages, and any other type of content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key enabler in this pattern is the availability of strcutured data for many items, and for a consitent set of attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "product   | size | color | price\n",
    "----------|------|-------|-------\n",
    "Product A |10    |blue   | 150\n",
    "Product B |12    |green  | 180\n",
    "Product C |15    |red    | 125\n",

    "\n",
    "A very simple prompt for a product description for one of those products can be something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Please create a product description for **Product A**\n",
    "Mention its size, which is **10**\n",
    "Also mention its color, which is **blue**\n",
    "And talk about its price: **150**\n",
    "The tone of voice should be professional\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have two important things to consider:\n",
    "1. We would like to scale our prompting to encompass all our products.\n",
    "2. The consistency of our data enables us to run the same process across many products.\n",
    "3. It would be great if we can save the process that generated our product descriptions. This is in order to debug issues, reproduce them again, and eventually update them by tweaking the prompt or by adding new product attributes whenever we have updated data.\n"

    "Let's take a quick look at some of the adavantages of this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reproducibility\n",
    "Eventually we will most likely want to update those descriptions. We might have a new SEO strategy and want to focus on other aspects of our products. We might get new data, like user ratings for example, and might want to incorporate a new line in our prompt, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scaling\n",
    "I think this is obvious. This approach clearly allows us to create descriptions on a large scale, provided we have consitent data, and that the items are similar (belonging to the same product category, or are of the same type).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugging\n",
    "If we see something wrong in our product descriptions, or some unwanted behavior, we can always go back and update our prompt template and clarify in a better way what we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Minimize hallucinations\n",
    "Trusting LLMs to create product descriptions for you is a very risky thing, because they are well-known for how easily they can invent \"facts\", and being \"confident\" about them.\n",
    "With this approach, we are restricting the factual information to the data that we provide, and we are also utilizing the great language processing capabilities of LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have clarified the approach and its benefits, let's see how this might be used in a real-life situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use LLMs for product descriptions on a large scale\n",
    "\n",
    "The example I will go through is for NBA player statistics. We will connect to the NBA data API, obtain carerr data for each player (per season, and per metric), and use that to create profile pages for each player.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Added value of using LLMs for product descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "What we are doing here is not a simple re-arrangement of what someone else wrote, and calling it our own. This would not add real value, and would not be an ethical thing to do. We are using publicly available data to uncover some insights, and with those facts create an interesting description. This description should make the reader better informed about the topic discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "With the availability of structured data about our players, we can make some calculations, and uncover some interesting facts that might not be immediately visible from the raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Charts\n",
    "\n",
    "Another added value of using raw data is that we can visualize for truly more insightful views into the players' careers.\n",
    "\n",
    "How easy is it to understand [Michael Jordan's career stats](https://nbastats.pro/player/Michael_Jordan) by looking at this table?\n",
    "\n",
    "![](michael_jordan_career_stats_table.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe this is better:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](michael_jordan_career_stats_chart.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Was it easy for you to spot the two seasons where he played a very low number of games, and that otherwise he played pretty much all games of all seasons?\n",
    "\n",
    "Was it clear from the table, that after his third year, his total points per season kept going down throughout his career (even though the games he played was stable, with two exceptions)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course those charts are not produced by the LLM. We will produce them with Plotly, a Python data visualization library, and of course we can use other libraries for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating prompt templates\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like with did with the toy example above, we will now create a prompt template for NBA players."

      "\n",
      "When it comes to the realm of basketball, few players possess the unique blend of skills and basketball IQ that Nikola Jokic brings to the court. As a key player for the Denver Nuggets since the 2015-2016 season, Jokic has not only solidified his place as one of the league's top players but has also become a fan favorite in the city of Denver, Colorado.\n",
      "\n",
      "Standing at 7 feet tall, Jokic cuts an imposing figure on the court, but it's his finesse and versatility that truly set him apart from his peers. With a stellar field goal percentage of 55.7%, Jokic has proven time and time again that he has the scoring touch to make an impact in any game situation. His ability to stretch the floor as a center, with a reliable mid-range shot and three-point range, makes him a nightmare matchup for opposing defenders.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Jokic's impact goes beyond just scoring. His passing ability and court vision are arguably what truly elevate his game to the next level. With an impressive 4667 assists over his career, Jokic is not just a scorer - he is a playmaker, constantly creating opportunities for his teammates and keeping the Nuggets' offense flowing smoothly.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the defensive end, Jokic is equally impactful. With 7249 total rebounds, including an impressive 1783 offensive rebounds, Jokic is a force on the boards, giving his team crucial second-chance opportunities and limiting opponents' offensive possessions. His 822 steals and 491 blocks also showcase his ability to disrupt plays and protect the rim when called upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a truly all-around player, Jokic's impact on the court cannot be overstated. His versatility, basketball IQ, and unique skill set make him a player that opposing teams must always account for and game-plan against. It's no wonder that he has become the face of the Denver Nuggets and a player that fans in the Mile High City have come to adore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through 675 games played and over 21,000 minutes on the court, Jokic has consistently proven himself as a reliable and game-changing presence for the Nuggets. His numbers speak for themselves - with 14139 points scored and counting, Jokic continues to be a dominant offensive force for his team.\n",
      "\n",
      "At just 29 years old, Jokic is still in the prime of his career, with plenty of basketball ahead of him. As he continues to evolve and refine his game, there's no telling how far he can take the Nuggets and what accolades he can achieve in the years to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "For fans of the game looking to witness a player who truly embodies the essence of modern basketball - a player who can score, pass, rebound, and defend with equal prowess - look no further than Nikola Jokic. Dive into the stats, dissect his game, and marvel at the skill and talent of this basketball virtuoso from Denver.\n",
